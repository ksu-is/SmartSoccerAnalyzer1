# SmartSoccerAnalyzer1
This project aims to track, store, and analyze detailed statistics for all players in Europe's 5 premier leagues which include Premier League, La Liga, Serie A, Bundesliga, and Ligue 1. It has goals to collect data on goals, assists, appearances, passing accuracy, defensive actions, and moreâ€”offering a centralized resource for performance insights. The repository will include data scraping scripts, a structured database, visual analytics dashboards, and tools for player comparison and trend analysis throughout the season.
It will cover attacking stats such as goals, assists, shots, expected goals/assists, key passes and chances created, dribble success and more
It will cover defensive stats such as tackles attempted/won, interceptions, blocks and clearances, duels won/lost
It will cover discipline and goalkeeping stats as well. 

If successfully ran, the code will have a feature where you can look up your favorite players and their corresponding stats will follow up.
